  <h2 id="quickanswer"><a href="#quickanswer">Quick answer</a></h2>
<p><dfn id="def_zaima">Zaima</dfn> is the name for Ge&rsquo;ez language chant hymns that are rendered with one or more independent interlinear lines of chant notation.
    Though different in purpose, Zaima presentation shares much in common with <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-ruby">Ruby</a> annotation.
  <p>The HTML5 specification provides a way to mark up ruby text, and 
    CSS can be used to fine tune of the positioning of ruby text. To a large extent the support for ruby text can also be applied to layout zaima text.</p>
</section>


<section>
  <h2 id="detail"><a href="#detail">Details</a></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Zaima&rdquo; is an English transcription for the Ge&rsquo;ez word ዜማ  (also transcribed as <em>Zeima</em> and <em>Zema</em>) which is the name
  given to a tradition of Ethiopian and Eritrean Orthodox Christian hymns sung in chant. Zaima recitation relies on a sophisticated system of chant notation
  marks similar in principal to other chanting traditions such as Znamenny, Syric, Byzantine and Hebrew cantillation.</p>
  <p>Zaima notation comprises separate systems of Qirts (ቅርጽ) and Miliket (ምልክት) which are used together and written at half scale above the hymn text.
  The systems are used together to denote the vocal inflection of base text hymn that they appear over.</p>
  <p>Zaima often features more than one interlinear line of notation  that are fully independent and never vocalized together. The
  notation lines may present a different &ldquo;mode&rdquo; (ስልት) of chant appropriate for a given occassion such as a celebration or memorial. A line may
  also present a different melody for the verse when it is repeated.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="types"><a href="#types">Components of Zaima</a></h2>
  <p>A full exposition on zaima that would explore its historic context, inventory the notation, and musicology aspects is beyond the scope of the
  review made here.  The following reviews the major visual components of zaima that are subject to delineation in markup languages and have layout
  and styling requirements in electronic documents.</p>
  <section>
  <h3 id="selt"><a href="#selt">Mode (ስልት)</a></h3>
  <p>Every line of Zaima notation embodies one of three modes (ስልት or more literally &ldquo;order&rdquo;) of melodic vocalization. The first of the three modes is Ge&rsquo;ez (ግዕዝ) which in fact
   means &ldquo;first&rdquo; in many contexts. It is the most frquent mode characterized by a strong, light and plain melody for everyday use (a 
   &ldquo;base&rdquo; mode).
   Ezil (ዕዝል) is somber and heavy sounding, its in a lower range than Ge&rsquo;ez mode and is used during fasting (such as during Lent), vigils (for example
   during Holy Week)and funerals.  By convention, Ezil notation will be rendered in red.
   Araray (ዓራራይ) is the upbeat, higher range mode characterized by strong, light and even jubilant.
   The mode is sometimes indicated within the hymn text or in a margin note (left side) but generally not as the pracitioner is expected to
   know the appropriate mode by virtue of his training or by inspection of the <a href="#miliket">miliket</a>.
  </p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3 id="qirts"><a href="#qirts">Qirts (ቅርጽ)</a></h3>
  <p><em>Qirts</em>, or <em>YeFidel Qirts</em>, are notation marks used soley to denote voice inflection in zaima and are rendered in the interlinear notation lines.
  They may be combined into chords for emphasis or modulation.
  Though some authors will apply a broad definition for <dfn>neumes</dfn> that include qirts marks, the qirts are generally not classified as such.
  Unlike typical neumes, qirts shapes do not reflect vocalization and their position does not indicate pitch. A subject of debate by purists,
  two special letters from the syllabary will be recognized as qirts.  These two are &lsquo;ር&rsquo;, short for &ldquo;አንብር&rsquo; (Anber) and
  &lsquo;ስ&rsquo; short for &ldquo;ደርስ&rdquo; (Dires). Anber and Dires are a special case of an abbreviation that is not grounded by a
  <a href="#sereyu">Sereyu</a> as are the <a href="#miliket">Miliket</a> which make them more akin to the atomic qirts.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3 id="miliket"><a href="#miliket">Miliket (ምልክት)</a></h3>
  <p><em>Miliket</em> are rendered on the interlinear notation lines and make up the bulk of zaima notation. Miliket number in the many hundrends and are
  abbreviations of a single word or of a few words. Like qirts the miliket define vocalization for the letters or word that they are positioned
  over. Miliket are specified by a context where the miliket itself was a word or phrase sung in the base text hymn and may have had qirts or
  other miliket applied to it. The context that grounds a miliket is known as its <a href="#sereyu">Sereyu</a>. Unlike qirts which will be
  used universally, many miliket are applicable only to a single volume of hymns.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3 id="sereyu"><a href="#sereyu">Sereyu (ሥረዩ)</a></h3>
  <p><em>Sereyu</em> marks a word in the base hymn as a reference point to define the vocalization of a miliket. The Sereyu point is marked with the
abbreviation &ldquo;ረዩ&rdquo; or &lsquo;ዩ&rsquo; and appears in the interlinear notation along with miliket and qirts but is never vocalized.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3 id="beit"><a href="#beit">Beit (ቤት)</a></h3>
  <p>Literally meaning &ldquo;house&rdquo; the beit are abbreviations similar to the miliket that appear in left side margin notes that indicate
  a <a href="#selt">mode</a> subcategory or &ldquo;family&rdquo; that the zaima&rsquo;s chant melody belongs to at a particular section.
  In some hymns, the beit category may change every few verses. Beit markers are very often rendered with the upper and lower enclosing bars
  from Ethiopic numerals which in turn may be rubricized in red while the abbreviation letters may be either red or black.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3 id="megdam"><a href="#megdam">Medgam (መድጋም)</a></h3>
  <p><em>Medgam</em> are Ethiopic numerals that appear in left side margin notes and signal that the line they are written adjacent to should be repeated
     (in accordance with the numeral&rsquo;s value). When a medgam number is present, the verse it applies to is first performed in vocal chant
     only following the lowest line of notation (this is known as <dfn>Qome Zaima</dfn>.  Incremental passes will follow successive lines upward
     and will likely be accompanied by the instruments sistrum and drum.  Unlike Beit, the medgam number may be rendered in a smaller point size
     (50% regular height as with the miliket).</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h3 id="haleita"><a href="#haleita">Halleluya Numbers (ሃሌታ)</a></h3>
  <p><em>Haleita</em> or &ldquo;halleluya numbers&rdquo; are rendered in the hymn line and are another system of reference to an entry in a
   &lduo;haleita table&rdquo; which indicates how the halleluya melody should be sung. The system is similar to miliket referencing and
   is grounded in a <a href="#beit">beit</a> context.
