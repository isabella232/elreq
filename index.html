      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section id="purpose">
      <h3>Purpose of this Document</h3>
      <p>This document describes requirements of the layout and presentation of text in the Ethiopic script for use with Web standards and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, Mobile Web and Digital Publications (e.g. eBooks). In addition to the Ethiopian and Eritrean homelands, the script is widely used througout the diaspora of these two nations. Accordingly, requirements are gathered from stakeholders engaged in Ethiopic publishing from all regions.</p>
      <p>The document does not describe implementations or issues related to specific technologies, such as CSS. Instead it describes the typographic requirements of Ethiopic in a technology-agnostic manner, so that the content remains evergreen and is equally relevant to all technologies that aim to represent Ethiopic text on the Web.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="how_developed">
      <h3>How this Docuemnt was Created</h3>
      <p>This document was created by the W3C Ethiopic Layout Task Force.  The Task Force will discussed many issues and harmonized the requirements from user communities and solutions from technological experts.</p> 
      <p>The following types of experts will be involved in the creation of this document:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ethiopic typography experts</li>
        <li>Experts from the publishing industry representing the spectrum of traditional to modern layout practices</li>
        <li>Academic experts with a focus on Ge'ez manuscripts and philogy</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Task Force will conduct a survey of the publishing industry to solicit input and identify the set of in-use layout styles. This document will then represent the normalized results of the industry survey which in turn becomes a basis for its validity and suitability to purpose. In the interim before to the survey results have been compiled and applied to this document, tentative specifications will be given based on the most-probable survey results anticipated from participating experts. <span class="note">Survey Pending</span> notes will appear along side specification sections to denote their status.</p>

      <h3>Basic Principles for Document Development</h3>
      <p>Growing out of the XX element <a href="#term.geez" class="termref">Ge'ez</a> language syllabary for two millenia, Ethiopic in its present day form is a multilingual, and multinational, script comprised by YY symbols reprsenting: syllables, numerals, punctuation and tonal marks.  Numerous linguistic, cultural, literary, historical and political issues surround the script and its utilization, all of which the authors strive to avoid discussing unless directly relevant to clarifying a given layout use case. The following principles are applied in the development of this document:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>View publishers as the primary stakeholders.</li>
        <li>Attempt a "90% solution" where the common and primary needs of publishers are addressed. Important but less widely used practices such as for <a href="#term.yared-zaima" class="termref">Yaredic Zaima Notation</a> will be addressed at a future time.</li> 
        <li>It does not cover every issue of Ethiopic typography, but only the import differences from the Western language systems.</li>
        <li>The technical aspects of actual implementation are not covered by this document.</li>
        <li>In order to help readers' understanding of how Ethiopic is used, typical real life examples are provided.</li>
        <li>Text layout rules and recommendations for readable design are different things, however these two issues are difficult to discuss independently. In this document, these two aspects are carefully separated. The aesthetic design recommendations are mainly described using notes.</li>
        <li>The main target of this document is common books. The authors' experiences are mainly related to common books, and the quality required for common books is the highest in the market. There are many kinds of books in the market, and the requirements are quite diverse. The task force has a lot of accumulated experience in requirements and solutions for Ethiopic text composition. Nonetheless, many issues, which have been discussed over a long period of time, are applicable for other kinds of publication.</li>
        <li>In terms of frequency of use, the importance of magazines, technical manuals, and Web documents rates alongside common books. However, there are several characteristics in these publications, which are different from common books. These issues should be treated more fully in future documents.</li>
      </ol>

      <section id="ethiopic_eras">
      <h3>In-Scope Publishing Eras</h3>
      <p>While Ethiopic documents can be characterized under a number of time periods, we discern only two gross eras in this document. <a href="#term.classical-ethiopic" class="termref">Classical Ethiopic</a> encompases the layout requirements found in the documents of the first printing presses and coming into fruition under the reign of Emperoror Haile Selassie.  While not the focus of this document, "Classical Ethiopic" also encompasses handwritten manuscripts whose practices are present in early publishing. This era is characterized more by the influences of the Ge'ez tradition as embodied by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church with respect to spelling conventions, syntax and punctuation use, Ethiopic Wordspace and numeral system preference, less variation in layout practice which is likely the result of having fewer publishing houses in operation.</p>

      <p>The Classical Ethiopic era is followed by the <a href="#term.modern-ethiopic" class="termref">Modern Ethiopic</a> spanning from the post-Imperial period up until the present day. Modern Ethiopic practices are characterized by looser spelling practices, the preference change toward whitespace and western numerals, more variation in layout styles  
and in some cases limitations imposed by desktop publishing software designed for Western markets.</p>

      <p>The focus of this document is on the Modern Ethiopic layout conventions with distinctions pertaining to Classical Ethiopic noted when known.  An exception will be a complication that the authors hope to resolve found in Classical era documents where Ethiopic Wordspace interplays with Whitespace in a number of contexts.</p>

    <h3>Justification</h3>
    <p>Since  the  arrival  of  the  printing  press  to  Ethiopia in  1863 (Pankhurst,  1998),  full  justification  of  Ethiopic  has  been  a common  typesetting  practice  in  Ethiopian,  and  later Eritrean,  publishing  houses.  Earlier,  Ethiopic  justification rules are a feature of Hiob Ludolf’s Historia Æthiopica which is noted as the first use of movable type for Ethiopic script (Ludolf, 1681). Prior to letterpress typography, calligraphic manuscripts  rendered  on  parchment  also  featured  full,  or approximately  full,  justification.  Though  the  latter  likely reflects  the  scribe’s  desire  not  to  waste  a  millimeter  of available lateral writing space.</p>
    <p>Two predominant forms of Ethiopic Justification developed  and would be of value to the present day user community.  Each form in turn has two sub-modes that govern spacing  following an Ethiopic Full Stop. Both forms and sub-modes  are discussed here. </p>

    <section id="justification_with_left_bounded_wordspace">
    <h4>Justification with Left Bounded Wordspace and Punctuation</h4>
    <p>In  keeping  with  line  justification for  Latin  script ,  the  non-printed  or  “white  space”  between  words  is treated as stretchable.  The width of the space symbol itself will be elongated to some aesthetic width  value that may vary from space symbol to space symbol across a printed line. In Ethiopic justification ,  the white space between the Ethiopic word separator  and the words it separates is likewise allowed to  stretch. This stretching of white space may be either symmetrical (“centered”) or asymmetrical but in  the latter case space stretching is always between  the right side of the separator and the following word  –referred to here as “left bounded”. </p>
    <p>In  “left  bounded”  justification  the  word  separator,   which  may  be  either  a  punctuation  symbol  or  <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡], appears to adhere to the word to the left as if it were its final character. </p>

    <section id="justification_with_centered_wordspace">
      <h4>Justification with Centered Wordspace and Punctuation</h4>
      <p>In the second major form of Ethiopic justification  the white space around word separators is stretched  equally on  both the left and right sides; giving the appearance of the separator being centered between the words  it divides.  <a href="#fig_justification_centered"></a>  depicts the white space stretching in both forms of justification using Ethiopic Wordspace as an example,  though the stretching rules apply equally to Ethiopic punctuation as well. </p>

    <h4>Spacing Threshold Following Full Stop</h4>
    <p>In the regular mode of Ethiopic justification (both  forms) <span class="uname">U+1362   ETHIOPIC FULL STOP</span> [።] will be treated equally  with all other punctuation symbols.  In a second mode, the Ethiopic full stop will have special spacing rules  applied to it whereby more separation space is allowed following the symbol and the start of the next  word.  In a sense, the right side space of the full stop is “more elastic” than in the regular mode.   The  elasticity rule and the visual effect are similar to that of the final line of a fully justified paragraph in  Western text.  When the final line of a paragraph of Latin script crosses a certain horizontal threshold,  the line will become fully justified. Below that threshold the line will appear left aligned.  The same rule  appears to be applied to the Ethiopic full stop but  on any line of the paragraph.  An illustration of  this  sub-mode is depicted in the following: </p>

     <section id="shorcomings_in_electronic_typesetting">
    <h4>Shortcomings Found in Electronic Typesetting Systems</h4>
    <p>To date, computer software that typesets text has a pplied justification rules for white space stretching  that were designed to meet publishing requirements  in the Western world.  When the same rules are  applied to Ethiopic text, the results are unsatisfactory as they do not meet user expectations. Largely  responsible for the formatting dissonance when Western justification is applied to Ethiopic text, is the  absence of a white space symbol in the writing system. There is no explicit white space symbol (in classic  Ethiopic writing) to be “stretched”.</p>
    <p>Formatting  algorithms  will  then  process  <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡] as  a  punctuation  symbol  where  word  binding rules, rather than word spacing rules, will  be applied.  While still stretchable, “white space” in  the Ethiopic  wordspace  is  implicit  rather  than  explicit.  For  a  complete  solution,  software  will  ultimately need to be enhanced to stretch implicit space as required.  Reclassifying the Ethiopic wordspace as a “Zs”  symbol  is  expected  to  help  alleviate  justification  issues  and  clears  the  way  for  software  firms  to  implement comprehensive support for Ethiopic justification. Since the Ethiopic wordspace interferes with  justification in present day software, users may opt not to use it or may “pad” wordspace and Ethiopic punctuation with explicit white space to obtain the  formatting desired.  The following samples depict  formatting  of  Kidane  Wolde  Kifle’s  seminal  work  <cite>Maṣḥafa  Sawāsew</cite> with  a  popular  word  processor  (Kifle, 1955 (1948 EC)) under the limitations of Western spacing rules justification.</p>

    <p>In digital documents such as in web pages and eBooks, it is recommended that the appearance of either  <span class="uname">U+0020   SPACE</span> [ ] or <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡] be  configurable  as  a user  preference.

    <h4>Ethiopic Semi-Justification</h4>
    <p>“Semi-justification”  is  mentioned  here  as  a  historical  note  and  to  provide  an  interpretation  of  formatting observed in hand written manuscripts. In  “semi-justification” the line spacing rules of  either mode of Ethiopic justification has been used, however, the text does not necessarily align  perfectly flush with the right side margin.  This practice is depicted in the following sample (Brita, 2012): </p>

    </section>



    <section id="wordspace_in_comma_context">
    <h4>Ethiopic Wordspace in the Context of Comma</h4>
    <p>In recent decades some communities have adopted a practice of employing the wordspace symbol as a  comma when <span class="uname">U+0020   SPACE</span> [ ] is used as the word separator. The  interpretation of the symbol is then dependent  on the context of the writing convention in use by  the author. Accordingly, an application user setting  could be offered to set the symbol context.</p>
    <p>An alternative view point on this practice is that   <span class="uname">U+1363   ETHIOPIC COMMA [፣]</span> is in fact in use by  these  user  communities;  however  its   glyph   has  decayed  whereby  the  line  segment  is  lost  and  so  it  visually coincides with <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡].  Under  this perspective, a simple solution would be modify an Ethiopic font for these users (perhaps adding an  alternative glyph in an OpenType stylistic set) where  the Ethiopic comma character address and semantics  remain intact though the visual form has been  tailored to meet aesthetic needs. </p>

    <h4>Alphabetic Lists</h4>
    <p>The Unicode standard encodes Ethiopic syllables for many languages using Ethiopic script past and present.
    Alphabetic lists are commonplace in Ethiopic literature, but will conform to the letter inventory of the language of the surrounding content.
    The alphabetical style lists specified here do not encompass <em>all</em> languages using Ethiopic, but only those with a demonstrated requirement as found in corpus or stakeholder input.</p>
