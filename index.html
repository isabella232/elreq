      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section id="purpose">
      <h3>Purpose of this Document</h3>
      <p>This document describes requirements of the layout and presentation of text in the Ethiopic script for use with Web standards and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, Mobile Web and Digital Publications (e.g. eBooks). In addition to the Ethiopian and Eritrean homelands, the script is widely used througout the diaspora of these two nations. Accordingly, requirements are gathered from stakeholders engaged in Ethiopic publishing from all regions.</p>
      <p>The document does not describe implementations or issues related to specific technologies, such as CSS. Instead it describes the typographic requirements of Ethiopic in a technology-agnostic manner, so that the content remains evergreen and is equally relevant to all technologies that aim to represent Ethiopic text on the Web.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="how_developed">
      <h3>How this Document was Created</h3>
      <p>This document was created by the W3C Ethiopic Layout Task Force.  The Task Force will discussed many issues and harmonized the requirements from user communities and solutions from technological experts.</p> 
      <p>The following types of experts will be involved in the creation of this document:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ethiopic typography experts</li>
        <li>Experts from the publishing industry representing the spectrum of traditional to modern layout practices</li>
        <li>Academic experts with a focus on Ge'ez manuscripts and philogy</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The Task Force will conduct a survey of the publishing industry to solicit input and identify the set of in-use layout styles. This document will then represent the normalized results of the industry survey which in turn becomes a basis for its validity and suitability to purpose. In the interim before to the survey results have been compiled and applied to this document, tentative specifications will be given based on the most-probable survey results anticipated from participating experts. <span class="note">Survey Pending</span> notes will appear along side specification sections to denote their status.</p>

      <h3>Basic Principles for Document Development</h3>
      <p>Growing out of the 182 element <a href="#term.geez" class="termref">Ge'ez</a> language syllabary for two millenia, Ethiopic in its present day form is a multilingual, and multinational, script comprised by 494 symbols representing: syllables, numerals, punctuation and tonal marks.  Numerous linguistic, cultural, literary, historical and political issues surround the script and its utilization, all of which the authors strive to avoid discussing unless directly relevant to clarifying a given layout use case. The following principles are applied in the development of this document:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>View publishers as the primary stakeholders.</li>
        <li>Attempt a "90% solution" where the common and primary needs of publishers are addressed. Important but less widely used practices such as for <a href="#term.yared-zaima" class="termref">Yaredic Zaima Notation</a> will be addressed at a future time.</li> 
        <li>It does not cover every issue of Ethiopic typography, but only the import differences from the Western language systems.</li>
        <li>The technical aspects of actual implementation are not covered by this document.</li>
        <li>In order to help readers' understanding of how Ethiopic is used, typical real life examples are provided.</li>
        <li>Text layout rules and recommendations for readable design are different things, however these two issues are difficult to discuss independently. In this document, these two aspects are carefully separated. The aesthetic design recommendations are mainly described using notes.</li>
        <li>The main target of this document is common books. The authors' experiences are mainly related to common books, and the quality required for common books is the highest in the market. There are many kinds of books in the market, and the requirements are quite diverse. The task force has a lot of accumulated experience in requirements and solutions for Ethiopic text composition. Nonetheless, many issues, which have been discussed over a long period of time, are applicable for other kinds of publication.</li>
        <li>In terms of frequency of use, the importance of magazines, technical manuals, and Web documents rates alongside common books. However, there are several characteristics in these publications, which are different from common books. These issues should be treated more fully in future documents.</li>
      </ol>

      <section id="ethiopic_eras">
      <h3>In-Scope Publishing Eras</h3>
      <p>While Ethiopic documents can be characterized under a number of time periods, we discern only two gross eras in this document. <a href="#term.classical-ethiopic" class="termref">Classical Ethiopic</a> encompases the layout requirements found in the documents of the first printing presses and coming into fruition under the reign of Emperoror Haile Selassie.  While not the focus of this document, "Classical Ethiopic" also encompasses handwritten manuscripts whose practices are present in early publishing. This era is characterized more by the influences of the Ge'ez tradition as embodied by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church with respect to spelling conventions, syntax and punctuation use, Ethiopic Wordspace and numeral system preference, less variation in layout practice which is likely the result of having fewer publishing houses in operation.</p>

      <p>The Classical Ethiopic era is followed by the <a href="#term.modern-ethiopic" class="termref">Modern Ethiopic</a> spanning from the post-Imperial period up until the present day. Modern Ethiopic practices are characterized by looser spelling practices, the preference change toward whitespace and western numerals, more variation in layout styles  
and in some cases limitations imposed by desktop publishing software designed for Western markets.</p>

      <p>The focus of this document is on the Modern Ethiopic layout conventions with distinctions pertaining to Classical Ethiopic noted when known.  An exception will be a complication that the authors hope to resolve found in Classical era documents where Ethiopic Wordspace interplays with Whitespace in a number of contexts.</p>

    <h3>Interlingual Documents with Ethiopic</h3>
    <p>Discuss any considerations for when foreign scripts (Latin, Arabic, etc) are used with Ethiopic text. Relative character heights and weights.</p>
    <section id="relative_character_heights">
        <h4>Relative Character Heights</h4>
        <p>In multilingual documents, differences between the heights of letters in Ethiopic script and its companion foreign script are often found.
        The difference is likely an artifact of the typesetting technology in use and does not represent the intent of the author or publisher.
        In the classic typeface style of Ethiopic script the letters will be of variable heights. Fixed height styles are more generally used for
        advertisement and not publishing. The nature of variable height Ethiopic letters is a factor that complicates how to be best align letter height with a foreign script.</p>
        <p>
        <figure id="inline_list_with_spaces">
          <img src="images/English-Ethiopic-Relative-Heights-3.png" border="1"/>
          <figcaption>Comparative heights of English and Ethiopic script.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
        At a given point size, letter heights within a script may vary widely between typefaces. This adds another level of difficulty
        to aligning heights between scripts as an alignment will only be optimal between a typeface pair. Within a script featuring variable
        (not fixed) height letters the relative heights of letters are subject to change between typefaces. This phenomena reinforces the
        previous assertion on typeface pair optimization, but also introduces the possibility that alignment optimization can be language
        sensistive. This happens when an alignment pair designed for the letter inventory of one language is applied to another language
        that includes letters that exceed the heights of the optimized set.
        <figure id="inline_list_with_spaces">
          <img src="images/Z-Reference-Monotype.png" border="1"/>
          <figcaption>Comparative letter heights.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>The relative heights of letters used in different languages may also change with typeface as this next figure illustrates.
        <figure id="inline_list_with_spaces">
          <img src="images/Z-Reference-Abyssinica.png" border="1"/>
          <figcaption>Comparative letter heights change with typeface, ቕ of Blin and Tigrinya now exceeds the heights of Amharic.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
        With these caveats considered, "Zen" alignment is a means to optimize an Ethiopic-Latin typeface pair that is suitable for a general
        use case when priori knowledge of a document language is unknown. Its basis is reviewed here.
        The Latin letter "Z" and Ethiopic letter "ን" are chosen as pairing symbols representative of the mean height .  The both feature broad
        horizontal strokes that are easy for the eye to follow as a nearly continuous stroke.
        Ethiopic letters that were introduced as an extension to the Ge'ez core will have typically feature a macron on other modifier at the top of
        a base letter in order to form the extension letter. The macron necessarily extends the height of a letter.  Using the top of the macron
        for the reference height of a letter leads to height alignment that makes the majority of Ethiopic letters appear too short against Latin letters.
        <figure id="inline_list_with_spaces">
          <img src="images/Z-Ny-N-Top-Aligned.png" border="1"/>
          <figcaption>Alignment and top of symbols (Ethiopic letters too squat).</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>
        A better approach is to align Z with caron (Ž) against ን with marcon (ኝ) while aligning and Z with ን and find typefaces with a good tuple of aligned pairings. 
        <figure id="inline_list_with_spaces">
          <img src="images/Z-caron-Ny-Z-N-Alignment.png" border="1"/>
          <figcaption>Alignment below accent (better sizing).</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p>Going furhter, we may assume that the ኝ and Ž will align satisfactorily (optionally check any irregularities) and simply align the Z-ን pair.
        Phonetically the sequence of these two letters would sound like "zen", hence the name.

          <figcaption>Z-ን or "Zen" Reference Alignment.</figcaption>

        </p>
        <p><em>Issues:</em>
		<ol><em>
		  <li>What Ethiopic letter should be applied as a height reference point for alignment?</li>
		  <li>Should height alignment be attempted as per the letter inventory of a target language level or for the script as a whole (practical but less optimal)?</li>
		  <li>Relative to a Latin uppercase letter, should the height of Ethiopic letters: (a) equal (b) shorter (c) taller?</li>
		  <li>Is height alignment an issue with other writing systems?  If so, how is it addressed?</li>
		</em></ol>

    </section>

    <section id="relative_typeface_weights">
        <h4>Relative Typeface Weights</h4>
        <p>A common practice in Ethiopic literature is the change of typeface weight in one script to appear more visually similar to the other.
        Most typically a Latin typeface will be made heavier to better match its Ethiopic counterpart.  This weight increase is demonstrated in many
        Ethiopic fonts that include the Latin letters. The font designer may have increased the weight of the Latin range primarily to provide heavier
        weight punctuation to use with Ethiopic script (see <a href="#ethiopicized_punctuation">Ethiopicized Punctuation</a>).</p>
        <p>Literature produced with a heavier Latin tyepface may represent the author's stylistic sensibilities but in some cases may be only be a
        pragmatic outcome when an author finds manually changing between fonts too burdensome. 
        The view of professional publishers is unknown here and should be determined.</p>
        <p><em>Issues:</em>
		<ol><em>
		  <li>When publishing in the classical Ethiopic weight, should English words appear in their default English weight?</li>
		  <li>If heavier Latin letters are desirable, how much so? Can a weight increase be defined as a percentage of the Ethiopic?</li>
		</em></ol>
		</p>
    </section>

    <section id="baseline_alignment">
        <h4>Baseline Alignment</h4>
        <p><em>This may only be an issue with pre-digital typesetting systems where Latin text and Ethiopic would appear to be
        laid out on different baselines in a line of text.  The most common example of this appears in documents produced with a typewriter
        where a sheet of paper had to be moved between typewriters to produce a line in two scripts.  An apparent baseline difference here
        would be the result of mechanical misalignment.</em></p>

    <section id="ethiopic_with_latin_punctuation">
    <h3>Latin Punctuation with Ethiopic</h3>
    <p><em>Discuss Latin/Western punctuation adopted for Ethiopic writing.  Ethiopicized (typeface stylized) punctuation. Reference the ES-781:2002 punctuation inventory.</em></p>

    <section id="ethiopicized_punctuation">
        <h4>Ethiopicized Punctuation</h4>
        <p>Modern Ethiopic borrows a number of foreign symbols to denote currency, express emphasis, time, mathematics, or communicate with
        Interenet protocols (e.g. "@" , "://" ).  
    	The ES-781:2002 standard identifies the following inventory of western symbols to be used with Ethiopic:</p>
    	<p style="margin-left: 20px"><code>1234567890 ? ! ¡ . / () [] {} &lt; = &gt; \ # % &amp; _ - + ± × ÷ ‘ ’  “ ” ‹ › « »</code></p>
    	<p>Additionally the following punctuation is observed to be used with Ethiopic writing:</p>
    	<p style="margin-left: 20px"><code>$ : , € @ …</code></p>


The shape and weight of these symbols are often changed for a better visual fit with an accompanying
        Ethiopic typeface. Enhanced foreign symbols are referred to here as "Ethiopicized". While many symbols are borrowed from western writing,
        not all necessarily benefit from Ethiopicization.  Those that do will primarily be used in a context where the foreign symbol directly
        abuts some Ethiopic symbol. Commonly Ethiopic symbols are demonstrated in the following figure:</p>

          <figcaption>Samples of Ethiopicized punctuation compared to shapes in a companion Latin typeface.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        </p>
        <p><em>Issues:</em>
		<ol><em>
		  <li>Are there any additional western symbols required for Ethiopic writing?</li>
		  <li>Are any symbols from other foreign script (Chinese, Arabic, etc) that should be included?</li>
		  <li>What symbols benefit from shape change?</li>
		  <li>What symbols benefit from weight change?</li>
                  <li>Noteworthy for layout correction is that an isolated left double guillemet, », is common in tabular text to indicate that the entry above is to be duplicated.</li>

    </section>

    <section id="optical_balancing">
        <h4>Optical Balancing</h4>
        <p>Foreign language words or phrases are regularly found inline within a paragraph of Ethiopic text, often enclosed within
        encompassing punctuation such as brackets and quotaiton marks (e.g. []()""''«»‹›).  This practice is most often observed in
        news articles on international topics.  The weight of the encompassing punctuation may found as matching either the Ethiopic
        Latin weight.  The preference of stakeholders must be determined here. Comparative samples follow:</p>

        </figure>
        <p>As a rule within the embedded foreign script, the weight of puncutation and other symbol (numbers, etc) should be in keeping
           with the weight of the foreign weight and not that of the surrounding Ethiopic.</p>
        <p><em>Issues:</em>

    <section id="ethiopic_wordspace_at_latin_boundaries">
    	<h4>Ethiopic Wordspace at Latin Boundaries</h4>
        <p>Classical era Ethiopic documents do not exhibit a very high degree of consistancy with respect to the presence of Ethiopic wordspace
        before or following Latin puncutation. Exceptions to an apparent convention are usually found within an individual document, making internal
        consistancy problematic for a work of any significant length beyond 20 pages. It is likely that the lack of a well established convention here
        would have kept copy editors and publishers view formatting conformance here as critical. Observed practices are:</p>
      	<dl>
          <dt>Always</dt>
          <dd>An Ethiopic word ends with either a wordspace or punctuation. This rule allows a word to be split across lines without the need for a hyphenation symbol.
          Ethiopic wordspace does not precede or follow another punctuation, with the possible exception when preceding a right-side enclosing symbol (brackets and quotation).
          </dd>
      	  <dt>Right-Side Enclosing Symbol Convention 1</dt>
      	  <dd>Ethiopic wordspace does not precede but does follow a right-side enclosing symbol. This appears to be the most commonly used convention during imperial times.</dd>
      	  <dt>Right-Side Enclosing Symbol Convention 2</dt>
      	  <dd>Ethiopic wordspace will precede a right-side enclosing symbol but not follow it. In these cases white space generally appears after
          the Latin punctuation, this whitespace is however observed as an artifact of justification spacing and does not demonstrate an inserted space symbol.
          The figure in this document illustrating <a href="#fig_justification_centered">centered wordspace justification style</a> provides an example of white space
          after quotation.  ፍቅር እስከ መቃብር by Haddis Alemayehu is also an easily found reference here.
          </dd>
      	  <dt>Right-Side Enclosing Symbol Convention 3</dt>
          <dd>Ethiopic wordspace does not precede or follow the right-side enclosing symbol. This style is observed but some width of white space will appear

        <p><em>[TBD: somewhere in this document mention the mouse text selection rule that a following wordspace should be automatically selected with text, analagous

    	<h4>Space-Wordspace Substitution Rules</h4>
    	<p>Rules are presented here to aid layout software that would offer the functionality of space symbol conversion to and from
    	Ethiopic wordspaces.
    	This functionality is desirable in a viewer application (e.g. web browser, eBook reader) to make the same
    	substitution as per a user preference.  Thus the user would be able to read a document with Ethiopic wordspaces that
    	was composed and delivered with white space. Likewise in the reverse, a user who preferred white space could have their preference

    	<h4>Ethiopic Gemination Mark (ጥበቅ) Vertical Positioning</h4>
        <p>The Ethiopic gemination mark, ጥበቅ, is almost universally found at a fixed height above the baseline in typeset literature. The marks position must
        then be fixed so that it remains above the tallest Ethiopic letter symbol; this produces a variable height gap between the top of the letter and the mark.
        Conversely, when the symbol is hand written (often above typeset text) the mark will be found at a varialbe height above the baseline and demonstrating
        a fixed height above the letter symbol.
        Quite possibly the former style is an artifact of a limitation of the layout technology employed, and the later representative of an author's
        desired rendering.</p>

    <h3>Justification</h3>
    <p>Since  the  arrival  of  the  printing  press  to  Ethiopia in  1863 (Pankhurst,  1998),  full  justification  of  Ethiopic  has  been  a common  typesetting  practice  in  Ethiopian,  and  later Eritrean,  publishing  houses.  Earlier,  Ethiopic  justification rules are a feature of Hiob Ludolf’s Historia Æthiopica which is noted as the first use of movable type for Ethiopic script (Ludolf, 1681). Prior to letterpress typography, calligraphic manuscripts  rendered  on  parchment  also  featured  full,  or approximately  full,  justification.  Though  the  latter  likely reflects  the  scribe’s  desire  not  to  waste  a  millimeter  of available lateral writing space.</p>
    <p>Two predominant forms of Ethiopic Justification developed  and would be of value to the present day user community.  Each form in turn has two sub-modes that govern spacing  following an Ethiopic Full Stop. Both forms and sub-modes  are discussed here. </p>

    <h4>Justification with Left Bounded Wordspace and Punctuation</h4>
    <p>In  keeping  with  line  justification for  Latin  script ,  the  non-printed  or  “white  space”  between  words  is treated as stretchable.  The width of the space symbol itself will be elongated to some aesthetic width  value that may vary from space symbol to space symbol across a printed line. In Ethiopic justification ,  the white space between the Ethiopic word separator  and the words it separates is likewise allowed to  stretch. This stretching of white space may be either symmetrical (“centered”) or asymmetrical but in  the latter case space stretching is always between  the right side of the separator and the following word  –referred to here as “left bounded”. </p>
    <p>In  “left  bounded”  justification  the  word  separator,   which  may  be  either  a  punctuation  symbol  or  <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡], appears to adhere to the word to the left as if it were its final character. </p>

    <h4>Spacing Threshold Following Full Stop</h4>
    <p>In the regular mode of Ethiopic justification (both  forms) <span class="uname">U+1362   ETHIOPIC FULL STOP</span> [።] will be treated equally  with all other punctuation symbols.  In a second mode, the Ethiopic full stop will have special spacing rules  applied to it whereby more separation space is allowed following the symbol and the start of the next  word.  In a sense, the right side space of the full stop is “more elastic” than in the regular mode.   The  elasticity rule and the visual effect are similar to that of the final line of a fully justified paragraph in  Western text.  When the final line of a paragraph of Latin script crosses a certain horizontal threshold,  the line will become fully justified. Below that threshold the line will appear left aligned.  The same rule  appears to be applied to the Ethiopic full stop but  on any line of the paragraph.  An illustration of  this  sub-mode is depicted in the following: </p>

     <section id="shorcomings_in_electronic_typesetting">
    <h4>Shortcomings Found in Electronic Typesetting Systems</h4>
    <p>To date, computer software that typesets text has applied justification rules for white space stretching  that were designed to meet publishing requirements  in the Western world.  When the same rules are  applied to Ethiopic text, the results are unsatisfactory as they do not meet user expectations. Largely  responsible for the formatting dissonance when Western justification is applied to Ethiopic text, is the  absence of a white space symbol in the writing system. There is no explicit white space symbol (in classic  Ethiopic writing) to be “stretched”.</p>
    <p>Formatting  algorithms  will  then  process  <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡] as  a  punctuation  symbol  where  word  binding rules, rather than word spacing rules, will  be applied.  While still stretchable, “white space” in  the Ethiopic  wordspace  is  implicit  rather  than  explicit.  For  a  complete  solution,  software  will  ultimately need to be enhanced to stretch implicit space as required.  Reclassifying the Ethiopic wordspace as a “Zs”  symbol  is  expected  to  help  alleviate  justification  issues  and  clears  the  way  for  software  firms  to  implement comprehensive support for Ethiopic justification. Since the Ethiopic wordspace interferes with  justification in present day software, users may opt not to use it or may “pad” wordspace and Ethiopic punctuation with explicit white space to obtain the  formatting desired.  The following samples depict  formatting  of  Kidane  Wolde  Kifle’s  seminal  work  <cite>Maṣḥafa  Sawāsew</cite> with  a  popular  word  processor  (Kifle, 1955 (1948 EC)) under the limitations of Western spacing rules justification.</p>

    <section id="wordspace_in_comma_context">
    <h4>Ethiopic Wordspace in the Context of Comma</h4>
    <p>In recent decades some communities have adopted a practice of employing the wordspace symbol as a  comma when <span class="uname">U+0020   SPACE</span> [ ] is used as the word separator. The  interpretation of the symbol is then dependent  on the context of the writing convention in use by  the author. Accordingly, an application user setting  could be offered to set the symbol context.</p>
    <p>An alternative view point on this practice is that   <span class="uname">U+1363   ETHIOPIC COMMA [፣]</span> is in fact in use by  these  user  communities;  however  its   glyph   has  decayed  whereby  the  line  segment  is  lost  and  so  it  visually coincides with <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡].  Under  this perspective, a simple solution would be modify an Ethiopic font for these users (perhaps adding an  alternative glyph in an OpenType stylistic set) where  the Ethiopic comma character address and semantics  remain intact though the visual form has been  tailored to meet aesthetic needs. </p>

    <h4>Alphabetical (ሀለሐመ) Lists</h4>
    <p>The Unicode standard encodes Ethiopic syllables for many languages using Ethiopic script past and present.
    Alphabetic lists are commonplace in Ethiopic literature, but will conform to the letter inventory of the language of the surrounding content.
    The alphabetical style lists specified here do not encompass <em>all</em> languages using Ethiopic, but only those with a demonstrated requirement as found in corpus or stakeholder input.</p>

    	<h4>አበገደ Lists</h4>
        <p>The አበገደ ordering of the Ethiopic syllabary is an alignment with the Coptic and Greek alphabets possibly to
        fascilitate interdenominational communication or for the transfer of gematria practices.
        The ordering is used today largely for pedagogical purposes and has been used by some authors for the collation of
        entire works such as dictionaries. More often authors will apply the ordering for list orders.</p>
    	<p>The አበገደ ordering is potentially desirable to any language using the Ethiopic syllabary.
    	The ordering is less likely to be found in the writing traditions of languages that have a written tradition of under a hundred years.
    	The language specific orders orders shown here are only those found utlized in corpus.</p>

      	<h3>Abbreviation formation</h3>
		<p>Abbreviations in Ethiopic languages will apply an abbreviation marker ("/" or ".") placed between the first letters of each word in a phrase.
		Single word abbreviation that applies a right side truncation (vs mid) will apply a "." as the abbreviation maker.
		In a multi-word abbreviations the last word may remain whole. Two letter words are only be abbreviated in a multi-word abbreviation. 
		</p>
		<p><strong>Examples:</strong><br/>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Single Word</span><br/>
		<span style="margin-left:40px;">
		ሚኒስትር ⇒ ሚ/ር</span><br/>
		<span style="margin-left:40px;">
		ሆስፒታል ⇒ ሆ/ል</span><br/>
		<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Multi Word</span><br/>
		<span style="margin-left:40px;">
      	ጠቅላይ ሚኒስትር ⇒ ጠ/ሚ/ር</span><br/>
      	<span style="margin-left:40px;">
      	ኢትዮጵያ ኦርቶዶክስ ተዋሕዶ ቤተ ክርስቲያን ⇒ ኢ/ኦ/ተ/ቤ/ክ</span>
      	</p>
      	<p><em>Issues:
		<ol>
		  <li>When "." is used as the abbreviation marker, it is sometimes found at the end of the abbreviation.</li>
		  <li>Confirm single word abbreviation rule.</li>
		  <li>Are mixed abbreviation markers appropriate? Some well established abbreviations apply a "." as the marker, for example
		  "አዲስ አበባ ዩኒቨርሲቲ" becomes "አ.አ.ዩ".  This may reflect the chosen convention of the institute.</li>
		  <li>What symbol is applied for foreign words transcribed into an Ethiopic languages?</li>
		  <li>Do copy editors or publishers set a policy for abbreviation, or leave it up to the author to decide?</li>
          <li>Of interest: when are abbreviations first found in Ethiopic writing and in what form?</li>

      	<h3>Ordinal Notation</h3>
     	 <p>An ordinal is formed in Amharic when "ኛ", and in Tigrinya when "ይ", follows a cardinal number.
     	 The ordinal marker is often, but not always, rendered in superscript form. The superscript practice is most prevalent with ordinals
     	 in western numerals, but is also applied with Ethiopic numerals.
     	<p><em>Issues:
		<ol>
		  <li>What letters should be superscripted, and it what contexts? For example, "ሳ" and "ብር" may also be superscripted in
		  presentation of prices but is not common in print (found mostly in store front advertising).</li>
		  <li>Always superscript? Language or locale specific? As a setting?</li>
		  <li>An argument goes that superscript of "ኛ" should not follow an Ethiopic numerals since the counting system is put into a Ge'ez context
		  and Ge'ez literature does not use a superscript.  Yet "ኛ" is appropriate to Amharic language and is not a letter found in Ge'ez. The class of
		  literature may be at issue here, such a religious materials.</li>

      	<h3>Ethiopic Comma Usage</h3>
      	<p><em>Rules of usage for the two Ethiopic commas. Note language specific conventions.</em></p>
      	<dl>
      	  <dt>፣ - ነጠላ ሠረዝ</dt>
      	  <dd>ETHIOPIC COMMA (አማ/ ነጠላ ሠረዝ, ትግ/ ንጽል ሰረዝ) is used as a comma in Ethiopian practices and as a semicolon in Eritrea. ፣ will also be
      	  used in Ge'ez writing as a semicolon (is this a modern usage or classic?).
      	  ETHIOPIC SEMICOLON, ፤, in turn is used as a colon in Eritrean writing (verify).</dd>
      	  <dt>፥ - ንዑስ ሠረዝ</dt>
      	  <dd>ETHIOPIC COLON in contrast to its Unicode name, is never(?) used as a colon in any known Ethiopic practices.
      	  Rather, it is a classical glyph variant of ETHIOPIC COMMA (፣). ፥ is the default comma glyph in Ge'ez writing and is the preferred
      	  comma glyph by some modern writers writing in other languages. ፥ is the default comma in most Amharic bibles, likely in keeping with
      	  the Ge'ez Bible that the Amharic would have been translated from.  Some modern Bible translations into Amharic, as well as other religious
      	  literature, will use ፣ as the default comma in prose but maintain ፥ for passage references, e.g. ማቴ4፥23 , ዮሐ13፥16 , etc. Given this
      	  common usage in religious materials "ecclesiastical comma" is a practical English term for referring to the ፥ glyph variant.  Kidane Wolde Kifle and Desta Tekle Wolde note the equivalence of the two commas.
      	  </dd>
      	  <dt>፡ - ንዑስ ነጥብ</dt>
      	  <dd>ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE (አማ/ ሁለት ነጥብ, ትግ/ ክልተ ነጥቢ) in keeping with Ge'ez heritage, is used as word separator (i.e. space) in the classical writing practices
      	      of both Eritrean and Ethiopia.  In in modern Eritrean writing practices in the role of a comma.
      	      When used in modern Ethiopian writing, it retains its classic role as word separator (space).
      	  </dd>
      	  <dt>, - comma</dt>
      	  <dd>COMMA is utilized in Eritrean and Ethiopian writing practices in the formatting of western numbers only.</dd>

   		 guillemets (‹ ›) in a secondary style. Single guillets will be used for inner-quotation and single word quotation.
   		 Modern Ethiopic writing will additionally utilize Latin quotation marks similarly (“ ” ‘ ’, U+201C, U+201D, U+2018, U+2019). 
   		 The choice of Latin script quotation may represent either an author preference or a software limitation that made quillemets
   		 unavailable or difficult to access.</p>

            Any number of kerning pairs and ligatures are possible for Ethiopic typography that would lead to better

            for setting the direction of future work to raise the topic with stakeholders to gauge the level of
            interest here. Producing visual samples (common lone words and full paragraphs) would help in the discussion
            of this topic.</p>
