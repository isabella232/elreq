    <h3>Justification</h3>
    <p>Since  the  arrival  of  the  printing  press  to  Ethiopia in  1863 (Pankhurst,  1998),  full  justification  of  Ethiopic  has  been  a common  typesetting  practice  in  Ethiopian,  and  later Eritrean,  publishing  houses.  Earlier,  Ethiopic  justification rules are a feature of Hiob Ludolf’s Historia Æthiopica which is noted as the first use of movable type for Ethiopic script (Ludolf, 1681). Prior to letterpress typography, calligraphic manuscripts  rendered  on  parchment  also  featured  full,  or approximately  full,  justification.  Though  the  latter  likely reflects  the  scribe’s  desire  not  to  waste  a  millimeter  of available lateral writing space.</p>
    <p>Two predominant forms of Ethiopic Justification developed  and would be of value to the present day user community.  Each form in turn has two sub-modes that govern spacing  following an Ethiopic Full Stop. Both forms and sub-modes  are discussed here. </p>

    <section id="justification_with_left_bounded_wordspace">
    <h4>Justification with Left Bounded Wordspace and Punctuation</h4>
    <p>In  keeping  with  line  justification for  Latin  script ,  the  non-printed  or  “white  space”  between  words  is treated as stretchable.  The width of the space symbol itself will be elongated to some aesthetic width  value that may vary from space symbol to space symbol across a printed line. In Ethiopic justification ,  the white space between the Ethiopic word separator  and the words it separates is likewise allowed to  stretch. This stretching of white space may be either symmetrical (“centered”) or asymmetrical but in  the latter case space stretching is always between  the right side of the separator and the following word  –referred to here as “left bounded”. </p>
    <p>In  “left  bounded”  justification  the  word  separator,   which  may  be  either  a  punctuation  symbol  or  <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡], appears to adhere to the word to the left as if it were its final character. </p>

    <section id="justification_with_centered_wordspace">
      <h4>Justification with Centered Wordspace and Punctuation</h4>
      <p>In the second major form of Ethiopic justification  the white space around word separators is stretched  equally on  both the left and right sides; giving the appearance of the separator being centered between the words  it divides.  <a href="#fig_justification_centered"></a>  depicts the white space stretching in both forms of justification using Ethiopic Wordspace as an example,  though the stretching rules apply equally to Ethiopic punctuation as well. </p>

Here  the  “design white space”, the space between the visible  symbol and the box border, is itself stretched as  needed to meet  line justification: </p>

    <h4>Spacing Threshold Following Full Stop</h4>
    <p>In the regular mode of Ethiopic justification (both  forms) <span class="uname">U+1362   ETHIOPIC FULL STOP</span> [።] will be treated equally  with all other punctuation symbols.  In a second mode, the Ethiopic full stop will have special spacing rules  applied to it whereby more separation space is allowed following the symbol and the start of the next  word.  In a sense, the right side space of the full stop is “more elastic” than in the regular mode.   The  elasticity rule and the visual effect are similar to that of the final line of a fully justified paragraph in  Western text.  When the final line of a paragraph of Latin script crosses a certain horizontal threshold,  the line will become fully justified. Below that threshold the line will appear left aligned.  The same rule  appears to be applied to the Ethiopic full stop but  on any line of the paragraph.  An illustration of  this  sub-mode is depicted in the following: </p>

     <section id="shorcomings_in_electronic_typesetting">
    <h4>Shortcomings Found in Electronic Typesetting Systems</h4>
    <p>To date, computer software that typesets text has a pplied justification rules for white space stretching  that were designed to meet publishing requirements  in the Western world.  When the same rules are  applied to Ethiopic text, the results are unsatisfactory as they do not meet user expectations. Largely  responsible for the formatting dissonance when Western justification is applied to Ethiopic text, is the  absence of a white space symbol in the writing system. There is no explicit white space symbol (in classic  Ethiopic writing) to be “stretched”.</p>
    <p>Formatting  algorithms  will  then  process  <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡] as  a  punctuation  symbol  where  word  binding rules, rather than word spacing rules, will  be applied.  While still stretchable, “white space” in  the Ethiopic  wordspace  is  implicit  rather  than  explicit.  For  a  complete  solution,  software  will  ultimately need to be enhanced to stretch implicit space as required.  Reclassifying the Ethiopic wordspace as a “Zs”  symbol  is  expected  to  help  alleviate  justification  issues  and  clears  the  way  for  software  firms  to  implement comprehensive support for Ethiopic justification. Since the Ethiopic wordspace interferes with  justification in present day software, users may opt not to use it or may “pad” wordspace and Ethiopic punctuation with explicit white space to obtain the  formatting desired.  The following samples depict  formatting  of  Kidane  Wolde  Kifle’s  seminal  work  <cite>Maṣḥafa  Sawāsew</cite> with  a  popular  word  processor  (Kifle, 1955 (1948 EC)) under the limitations of Western spacing rules justification.</p>

    </figure>
    <p>In digital documents such as in web pages and eBooks, it is recommended that the appearance of either  <span class="uname">U+0020   SPACE</span> [ ] or <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡] be  configurable  as  a user  preference.  An  easy to  access “space”  toggle  button would enhance a viewing application’s usability.</p>

    <h4>Ethiopic Semi-Justification</h4>
    <p>“Semi-justification”  is  mentioned  here  as  a  historical  note  and  to  provide  an  interpretation  of  formatting observed in hand written manuscripts. In  “semi-justification” the line spacing rules of  either mode of Ethiopic justification has been used, however, the text does not necessarily align  perfectly flush with the right side margin.  This practice is depicted in the following sample (Brita, 2012): </p>

    <section id="wordspace_in_comma_context">
    <h4>Ethiopic Wordspace in the Context of Comma</h4>
    <p>In recent decades some communities have adopted a practice of employing the wordspace symbol as a  comma when <span class="uname">U+0020   SPACE</span> [ ] is used as the word separator. The  interpretation of the symbol is then dependent  on the context of the writing convention in use by  the author. Accordingly, an application user setting  could be offered to set the symbol context.</p>
    <p>An alternative view point on this practice is that   <span class="uname">U+1363   ETHIOPIC COMMA [፣]</span> is in fact in use by  these  user  communities;  however  its   glyph   has  decayed  whereby  the  line  segment  is  lost  and  so  it  visually coincides with <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡].  Under  this perspective, a simple solution would be modify an Ethiopic font for these users (perhaps adding an  alternative glyph in an OpenType stylistic set) where  the Ethiopic comma character address and semantics  remain intact though the visual form has been  tailored to meet aesthetic needs. </p>
