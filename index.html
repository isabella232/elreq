      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <section id="purpose">
    <h3>Purpose of this Document</h3>
    <p>This document describes requirements of the layout and presentation of text in the Ethiopic script for use with Web standards and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, Mobile Web and Digital Publications (e.g. eBooks). In addition to the Ethiopian and Eritrean homelands, the script is widely used througout the diaspora of these two nations. Accordingly, requirements are gathered from stakeholders engaged in Ethiopic publishing from all regions.</p>
    <p>The document does not describe implementations or issues related to specific technologies, such as CSS. Instead it describes the typographic requirements of Ethiopic in a technology-agnostic manner, so that the content remains evergreen and is equally relevant to all technologies that aim to represent Ethiopic text on the Web.</p>
  </section>
      <section id="how_developed">
    <h3>How this Document was Created</h3>
    <p>This document was created by the W3C Ethiopic Layout Task Force.  The Task Force will discuss many issues and harmonize the requirements from user communities and solutions from technological experts.</p>
    <p>The following types of experts will be involved in the creation of this document:</p>
    <ol>
          <li>Ethiopic typography experts</li>
          <li>Experts from the publishing industry representing the spectrum of traditional to modern layout practices</li>
          <li>Academic experts with a focus on <a href="#term.geez" class="termref">Ge'ez</a> manuscripts and philogy</li>
        </ol>
    <p>The Task Force will conduct a survey of the publishing industry to solicit input and identify the set of in-use layout styles. This document will then represent the normalized results of the industry survey which in turn becomes a basis for its validity and suitability to purpose. In the interim before to the survey results have been compiled and applied to this document, tentative specifications will be given based on the most-probable survey results anticipated from participating experts. <span class="note">Survey Pending</span> notes will appear along side specification sections to denote their status.</p>

    <h3>Basic Principles for Document Development</h3>
    <p>Growing out of the 182 element Ge'ez language syllabary for two millenia, Ethiopic in its present day form is a multilingual, and multinational, script comprised by 494 symbols representing: syllables, numerals, punctuation and tonal marks.  Numerous linguistic, cultural, literary, historical and political issues surround the script and its utilization -all of which the authors strive to avoid discussing unless directly relevant to clarifying a given layout use case. The following principles are applied in the development of this document:</p>
    <ol>
          <li>View publishers as the primary stakeholders.</li>
          <li>Attempt a “90% solution” where the common and primary needs of publishers are addressed. Important but less widely used practices such as for <a href="#term.yaredic-zaima-notation" class="termref">Yaredic Zaima Notation</a> will be addressed at a future time.</li>
          <li>It does not cover every issue of Ethiopic typography, but only the import differences from the Western language systems.</li>
          <li>The technical aspects of actual implementation are not covered by this document.</li>
          <li>In order to help readers' understanding of how Ethiopic is used, typical real life examples are provided.</li>
          <li>Text layout rules and recommendations for readable design are different things, however these two issues are difficult to discuss independently. In this document, these two aspects are carefully separated. The aesthetic design recommendations are mainly described using notes.</li>
          <li>The main target of this document is common books. The authors' experiences are mainly related to common books, and the quality required for common books is the highest in the market. There are many kinds of books in the market, and the requirements are quite diverse. The task force has a lot of accumulated experience in requirements and solutions for Ethiopic text composition. Nonetheless, many issues, which have been discussed over a long period of time, are applicable for other kinds of publication.</li>
          <li>In terms of frequency of use, the importance of magazines, technical manuals, and Web documents rates alongside common books. However, there are several characteristics in these publications, which are different from common books. These issues should be treated more fully in future documents.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>In-Scope Publishing Eras</h3>
    <p>While Ethiopic documents can be characterized under a number of time periods, we discern only two gross eras herein. <a href="#term.classical-ethiopic" class="termref">Classical Ethiopic</a> encompases the layout requirements found in the documents of the first printing presses and coming into fruition under the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie.  While not the focus of this document, “Classical Ethiopic” also encompasses handwritten manuscripts whose practices are present in early publishing. This era is characterized more by the influences of the Ge'ez tradition as embodied by the Ethiopian Orthodox Church with respect to spelling conventions, syntax and punctuation use, <a href="#term.wordspace" class="termref">Ethiopic Wordspace</a> and numeral system preference. Also featuring less variation in layout practice which is likely the result of having fewer publishing houses in operation.</p>
    <p>The Classical Ethiopic era is followed by <a href="#term.modern-ethiopic" class="termref">Modern Ethiopic</a> spanning from the post-Imperial period up until the present day. Modern Ethiopic practices are characterized by looser spelling conventions, the preference change toward whitespace and western numerals, more variation in layout styles  
          and in some cases limitations imposed by desktop publishing software designed for Western markets.</p>
    <p>The focus of this document is on the Modern Ethiopic layout conventions with distinctions pertaining to Classical Ethiopic noted when known.  An exception will be a complication that the authors hope to resolve found in Classical era documents where Ethiopic Wordspace interplays with Whitespace in a number of contexts.</p>

    <h3>Interlingual Documents with Ethiopic</h3>
    <p><em>Discuss any considerations for when foreign scripts (Latin, Arabic, etc) are used with Ethiopic text. Relative character heights and weights.</em></p>
    <section id="relative_character_heights">
          <h4>Relative Character Heights</h4>
          <p>In multilingual documents, differences between the heights of letters in Ethiopic script and its companion foreign script are often found.
        The difference is likely an artifact of the typesetting technology in use and does not represent the intent of the author or publisher.
        In the classic typeface style of Ethiopic script the letters will be of variable heights. Fixed height styles are more generally used for
        advertisement and not publishing. The nature of variable height Ethiopic letters is a factor that complicates how to be best align letter height with a foreign script.</p>
          <figure id="comparative_heights_latn_ethi"> <img src="images/English-Ethiopic-Relative-Heights-With-Guide-Lines.png" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>Comparative heights of English and Ethiopic script.</figcaption>
      </figure>
          <p> At a given point size, letter heights within a script may vary widely between typefaces. This adds another level of difficulty
        to aligning heights between scripts as an alignment will only be optimal between a typeface pair. Within a script featuring variable
        (not fixed) height letters the relative heights of letters are subject to change between typefaces. This phenomena reinforces the
        previous assertion on typeface pair optimization, but also introduces the possibility that alignment optimization can be language
        sensistive. This happens when an alignment pair designed for the letter inventory of one language is applied to another language
        that includes letters that exceed the heights of the optimized set. </p>
          <figure id="comparative_height_typeface"> <img src="images/Z-Reference-Monotype.png" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>Comparative letter heights.</figcaption>
      </figure>
          <p>The relative heights of letters used in different languages may also change with typeface as this next figure illustrates. </p>
          <figure id="comparative_height_blin_tigrinya"> <img src="images/Z-Reference-Abyssinica.png" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>Comparative letter heights change with typeface, ቕ of Blin and Tigrinya now exceeds the heights of Amharic.</figcaption>
      </figure>
          <p> With these caveats considered, “Zen” alignment is a means to optimize an Ethiopic-Latin typeface pair that is suitable for a general
        use case when priori knowledge of a document language is unknown. Its basis is reviewed here.
        The Latin letter “Z” and Ethiopic letter "ን" are chosen as pairing symbols representative of the mean height .  The both feature broad
        horizontal strokes that are easy for the eye to follow as a nearly continuous stroke.
        Ethiopic letters that were introduced as an extension to the Ge'ez core will have typically feature a macron on other modifier at the top of
        a base letter in order to form the extension letter. The macron necessarily extends the height of a letter.  Using the top of the macron
        for the reference height of a letter leads to height alignment that makes the majority of Ethiopic letters appear too short against Latin letters. </p>
          <figure id="align_top_symbol"> <img src="images/Z-Ny-N-Top-Aligned.png" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>Alignment and top of symbols (Ethiopic letters too squat).</figcaption>
      </figure>
          <p> A better approach is to align Z with caron (Ž) against ን with marcon (ኝ) while aligning and Z with ን and find typefaces with a good tuple of aligned pairings.</p>
          <figure id="align_below_accent"> <img src="images/Z-caron-Ny-Z-N-Alignment.png" alt=""/>
        <figcaption>Alignment below accent (better sizing).</figcaption>
      </figure>
          <p>Going further, we may assume that the ኝ and Ž will align satisfactorily (optionally check any irregularities) and simply align the Z-ን pair.
        Phonetically the sequence of these two letters would sound like “zen”, hence the name.</p>

    <section id="relative_typeface_weights">
          <h4>Relative Typeface Weights</h4>
          <p>A common practice in Ethiopic literature is the change of typeface weight in one script to appear more visually similar to the other.
        Most typically a Latin typeface will be made heavier to better match its Ethiopic counterpart.  This weight increase is demonstrated in many
        Ethiopic fonts that include the Latin letters. The font designer may have increased the weight of the Latin range primarily to provide heavier
        weight punctuation to use with Ethiopic script (see <a href="#ethiopicized_punctuation">Ethiopicized Punctuation</a>).</p>
          <p>Literature produced with a heavier Latin tyepface may represent the author's stylistic sensibilities but in some cases may be only be a
        pragmatic outcome when an author finds manually changing between fonts too burdensome. 
        The view of professional publishers is unknown here and should be determined.</p>

          <h4>Baseline Alignment</h4>
          <p><em>This may only be an issue with pre-digital typesetting systems where Latin text and Ethiopic would appear to be
            laid out on different baselines in a line of text.  The most common example of this appears in documents produced with a typewriter
            where a sheet of paper had to be moved between typewriters to produce a line in two scripts.  An apparent baseline difference here
            would be the result of mechanical misalignment.</em></p>

    <h3>Latin Punctuation with Ethiopic</h3>
    <p class="issues">Discuss Latin/Western punctuation adopted for Ethiopic writing.  Ethiopicized (typeface stylized) punctuation. Reference the ES-781:2002 punctuation inventory.</p>
    <section id="ethiopicized_punctuation">
          <h4>Ethiopicized Punctuation</h4>
          <p>Modern Ethiopic borrows a number of foreign symbols to denote currency, express emphasis, time, mathematics, or communicate with
        Internet protocols (e.g. "@" , "://"). 
        The ES-781:2002 standard identifies the following inventory of western symbols to be used with Ethiopic:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px"><code>1234567890 ? ! ¡ . / () [] {} &lt; = &gt; \ # % &amp; _ - + ± × ÷ ‘ ’  “ ” ‹ › « »</code></p>
          <p>Additionally the following punctuation is observed to be used with Ethiopic writing:</p>
          <p style="margin-left: 20px"><code>$ : , € @ …</code></p>
          <p>The shape and weight of these symbols are often changed for a better visual fit with an accompanying
        Ethiopic typeface. Enhanced foreign symbols are referred to here as <a href="#term.ethiopicized" class="termref">“Ethiopicized”</a>. While many symbols are borrowed from western writing,
        not all necessarily benefit from Ethiopicization.  Those that do will primarily be used in a context where the foreign symbol directly
        abuts some Ethiopic symbol. Commonly Ethiopic symbols are demonstrated in the following figure:</p>

        news articles on international topics.  The weight of the encompassing punctuation may found as matching either the Ethiopic
        Latin weight.  The preference of stakeholders must be determined here. Comparative samples follow:</p>

          <h4>Ethiopic Wordspace at Latin Boundaries</h4>
          <p>Classical era Ethiopic documents do not exhibit a very high degree of constency with respect to the presence of Ethiopic wordspace
        before or following Latin punctuation. Exceptions to an apparent convention are usually found within an individual document, making internal
        constency problematic for a work of any significant length beyond 20 pages. It is likely that the lack of a well established convention here
        would have kept copy editors and publishers view formatting conformance here as critical. Observed practices are:</p>
          <dl>
        <dt>Always</dt>
        <dd>An Ethiopic word ends with either a wordspace or punctuation. This rule allows a word to be split across lines without the need for a hyphenation symbol.
              Ethiopic wordspace does not precede or follow another punctuation, with the possible exception when preceding a right-side enclosing symbol (brackets and quotation). </dd>
        <dt>Right-Side Enclosing Symbol Convention 1</dt>
        <dd>Ethiopic wordspace does not precede but does follow a right-side enclosing symbol. This appears to be the most commonly used convention during imperial times.</dd>
        <dt>Right-Side Enclosing Symbol Convention 2</dt>
        <dd>Ethiopic wordspace will precede a right-side enclosing symbol but not follow it. In these cases white space generally appears after
              the Latin punctuation, this whitespace is however observed as an artifact of justification spacing and does not demonstrate an inserted space symbol.
              The figure in this document illustrating <a href="#fig_justification_centered">centered wordspace justification style</a> provides an example of white space
              after quotation.  ፍቅር እስከ መቃብር by Haddis Alemayehu (Alemayehu, 1965 (1958 EC)) is also an easily found reference here. </dd>
        <dt>Right-Side Enclosing Symbol Convention 3</dt>
        <dd>Ethiopic wordspace does not precede or follow the right-side enclosing symbol. This style is observed but some width of white space will appear

          <h4>Space-Wordspace Substitution Rules</h4>

          <h4>Ethiopic Gemination Mark (ጥበቅ) Vertical Positioning</h4>
          <p>The Ethiopic gemination mark, ጥበቅ, is almost universally found at a fixed height above the baseline in typeset literature. The mark's position must
        then be fixed so that it remains above the tallest Ethiopic letter symbol; this produces a variable height gap between the top of the letter and the mark.
        Conversely, when the symbol is hand written (often above typeset text) the mark will be found at a variable height above the baseline and demonstrating
        a fixed height above the letter symbol.
        Quite possibly the former style is an artifact of a limitation of the layout technology employed, and the later representative of an author's
        desired rendering.</p>

          <h4>Justification When ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE is the Word Delimiter</h4>
          <p>Since the arrival of the printing press to Ethiopia in 1863 (Pankhurst, 1998), full justification of Ethiopic has been a common typesetting practice in Ethiopian, and later Eritrean, publishing houses. Earlier, Ethiopic justification rules are a feature of Hiob Ludolf’s Historia Æthiopica which is noted as the first use of movable type for Ethiopic script (Ludolf, 1681). Prior to letterpress typography, calligraphic manuscripts rendered on parchment also featured full, or approximately full, justification. Though the latter likely reflects the scribe’s desire not to waste a millimeter of available lateral writing space.</p>
          <p>The placement of Ethiopic wordspace presents a complication to the justification of Ethiopic text. Two placement styles developed in typeset
        literature which will be referred to here as “word bounded” and “centered” styles. Additionally, the word spacing following an Ethiopic fullstop
        may (or may not) be governed by a special rule and in combination with the two wordspace spacing styles. These spacing rules are discussed in the
        following sections.</p>

          <h5>Justification with Word Bounded Wordspace and Punctuation</h5>
          <p>In keeping with line justification for Latin script, the non-printed or “white space” between words is treated as stretchable. The width of the space symbol itself will be elongated to some aesthetic width value that may vary from space symbol to space symbol across a printed line. In Ethiopic justification, the white space between the Ethiopic word separator and the words it separates is likewise allowed to stretch. This stretching of white space may be either symmetrical (“centered”) or asymmetrical but in the latter case space stretching is always between the right side of the separator and the following word –referred to here as “word bounded”. </p>
          <p>In  “word  bounded”  justification  the  word  separator,   which  may  be  either  a  punctuation  symbol  or <span class="uname">U+1361   ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡], appears to adhere to the word to the left as if it were its final character. Figures <a href="#justification_word_bounded"></a> and <a href="#justification_in_historia_aethiopica"></a> both illustrate the word bounded style.</p>

In a second mode, the Ethiopic full stop will have special spacing rules applied to it whereby more separation space is allowed following the symbol and the start of the next word.  In a sense, the right side space of the full stop is “more elastic” than in the regular mode.  The elasticity rule and the visual effect are similar to that of the final line of a fully justified paragraph in Western text.  When the final line of a paragraph of Latin script crosses a certain horizontal threshold, the line will become fully justified. Below that threshold the line will appear left aligned.  The same rule appears to be applied to the Ethiopic full stop but on any line of the paragraph.  An illustration of this sub-mode is depicted in the following: </p>

          <h5>Shortcomings Found in Electronic Typesetting Systems</h5>
          <p>To date, computer software that typesets text has applied justification rules for white space stretching  that were designed to meet publishing requirements  in the Western world.  When the same rules are  applied to Ethiopic text, the results are unsatisfactory as they do not meet user expectations. Largely  responsible for the formatting dissonance when Western justification is applied to Ethiopic text, is the  absence of a white space symbol in the writing system. There is no explicit white space symbol (in classic  Ethiopic writing) to be “stretched”.</p>
          <p>Formatting algorithms will then process <span class="uname">U+1361 ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡] as a punctuation symbol where word enclosing rules, rather than word spacing rules, will be applied.  While still stretchable, “white space” in the Ethiopic wordspace is implicit rather than explicit.  For a complete solution, software will ultimately need to be enhanced to stretch implicit space as required.  Reclassifying the Ethiopic wordspace as a “Zs” symbol is expected to help alleviate justification issues and clears the way for software firms to implement comprehensive support for Ethiopic justification. Since the Ethiopic wordspace interferes with justification in present day software, users may opt not to use it or may “pad” wordspace and Ethiopic punctuation with explicit white space to obtain the formatting desired.  The following samples depict formatting of Kidane Wolde Kifle’s seminal work <cite>Maṣḥafa Sawāsew</cite> with a popular word processor (Kifle, 1955 (1948 EC)) under the limitations of Western spacing rules justification.</p>

          <h4>List Item Marker Alignment</h4>
          <p>Ethiopic corpus will present lists with two styles of alignment. These are a left side alignment at the
        list counter, or alignment along the list marker (suffix). Layout software will align a list at the marker in
        keeping with the later style.  The former style (left justified at counter) may reflect a limitation of the
        layout technology employed and not a preference of the author, copy editor or typesetter. A depiction of these
        two alignment styles is presented in the following figures:</p>

          <h4>Alphabetical (ሀለሐመ) Lists</h4>
          <p>The Unicode standard encodes Ethiopic syllables for many languages using Ethiopic script past and present.
        Alphabetic lists are commonplace in Ethiopic literature, but will conform to the letter inventory of the language of the surrounding content.
        The alphabetical style lists specified here do not encompass <em>all</em> languages using Ethiopic, but only those with a demonstrated requirement as found in corpus or stakeholder input.</p>

          <h4>አበገደ Lists</h4>
          <p>The አበገደ ordering of the Ethiopic syllabary is an alignment with the Coptic and Greek alphabets possibly to
        facilitate interdenominational communication or for the transfer of gematria practices.
        The ordering is used today largely for pedagogical purposes and has been used by some authors for the collation of
        entire works such as dictionaries. More often authors will apply the ordering for list orders.</p>
          <p>The አበገደ ordering is potentially desirable to any language using the Ethiopic syllabary.
        The ordering is less likely to be found in the writing practices of languages that have a written tradition of under a hundred years.

      <h2>Ethiopic Emphasis</h2>
      <p>Classical Ethiopic writing does not feature a letter shape stylistic change to communicate word emphasis. In religious works, the color red will be used to emphasize a spiritual aspect of a word in a passage.  Emphasis in modern Ethiopic writing will employ every emphasis device available from the available publishing technology (e.g. underline, slant, embolden, letter size, letter outline, background shapes, etc.). The practice however is idiosyncratic and inconsistently applied leading to debate and disagreement within the publishing community.</p>
      <p>The following subsections present a proposed best practice of the authors.</p>
      <section id="heading_emphasis">
    <h3>Section Headings</h3>
    <p><em>[Consider if all or part of this section should be integrated with <a href="#html5-alignment"></a>]</em></p>
    <p>The default section headings stylistic changes (size, weight) applied to Roman script in word processors and web browsers are generally applicable to Ethiopic literature.  In classic and modern layout practices applied to books and magazines, the document and chapter titles will be centered. The use of underlining and color changes are not recommended for Ethiopic headings as they are not a traditional practice.</p>
    <p>The following presents the six heading levels defined in the HTML standard and their applicable context in Ethiopic literature.  Samples are provided here for review and consideration of the default settings for letter sizing and line spacing.</p>
    <dl>
          <dt>Heading 1</dt>

          <dt>Heading 5</dt>

    <p>In religous literature, certain words or phrases with a spiritual or more holy aspect may be colored in red.  The practice is context dependent and a word that will appear in red in one sentence may not be red in the next (or elsewhere in the same sentence).</p>

    <section id="ethiopic_comma_usage">
          <h3>Ethiopic Comma Usage</h3>
          <p>In Ethiopic writing practices three encoded symbols will be used in the context of comma, however they are generally not used together.
        Looked at another way, the Ethiopic comma may appear with three different glyphs. The western comma also has an important role in Ethiopic writing.
        Usage rules are as follows:</p>
          <dl>
        <dt>፣ - ነጠላ ሠረዝ</dt>
        <dd>ETHIOPIC COMMA (አማ/ ነጠላ ሠረዝ, ትግ/ ንጽል ሰረዝ) is used as a comma in Ethiopian practices and as a semicolon in Eritrea. ፣ will also be
              used in Ge'ez writing as a semicolon (is this a modern usage or classic?).
              ETHIOPIC SEMICOLON, ፤, in turn is used as a colon in Eritrean writing (verify).</dd>
        <dt>፥ - ንዑስ ሠረዝ</dt>
        <dd>ETHIOPIC COLON in contrast to its Unicode name, is never(?) used as a colon in any known Ethiopic practices.
              Rather, it is a classical glyph variant of ETHIOPIC COMMA (፣). ፥ is the default comma glyph in Ge'ez writing and is the preferred
              comma glyph by some modern writers writing in other languages. ፥ is the default comma in most Amharic bibles, likely in keeping with
              the Ge'ez Bible that the Amharic would have been translated from.  Some modern Bible translations into Amharic, as well as other religious
              literature, will use ፣ as the default comma in prose but maintain ፥ for passage references, e.g. ማቴ4፥23 , ዮሐ13፥16 , etc. Given this
              common usage in religious materials "ecclesiastical comma" is a practical English term for referring to the ፥ glyph variant.  Kidane Wolde Kifle and Desta Tekle Wolde note the equivalence of the two commas. </dd>
        <dt>፡ - ንዑስ ነጥብ</dt>
        <dd>ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE (አማ/ ሁለት ነጥብ, ትግ/ ክልተ ነጥቢ) in keeping with Ge'ez heritage, is used as the word separator (i.e. space) in the classical writing practices
              of both Eritrean and Ethiopia.  In modern Eritrean writing practices ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE will be used in the role of a comma (illustrated in Figure <a href="#ecclesiastical_emphasis_sample"></a>).
              When used in modern Ethiopian writing, it retains its classic role as word separator (space).
              See <a href="#wordspace_in_comma_context"></a> for elaboration on this topic. </dd>
        <dt>, - comma</dt>

    <section id="wordspace_in_comma_context">
          <h3>Ethiopic Wordspace in the Context of Comma</h3>
          <p>In recent decades some communities have adopted a practice of employing the wordspace symbol as a comma when <span class="uname">U+0020 SPACE</span> [ ] is used as the word separator. The interpretation of the symbol is then dependent on the context of the writing convention in use by the author. Accordingly, an application user setting could be offered to set the symbol context.</p>
          <p>An alternative view point on this practice is that <span class="uname">U+1363 ETHIOPIC COMMA [፣]</span> is in fact in use by these user communities; however its glyph has decayed whereby the line segment is lost and so it visually coincides with <span class="uname">U+1361 ETHIOPIC WORDSPACE</span> [፡].  Under this perspective, a simple solution would be modify an Ethiopic font for these users (perhaps adding an alternative glyph in an OpenType stylistic set) where the Ethiopic comma character address and semantics remain intact though the visual form has been tailored to meet aesthetic needs. </p>

Doing so simplifies spacing rules for the Wordspace symbol as the comma usage context will not need to be addressed.

              the wordspace is sometimes found both before and following the closing parenthesis.  An example to illustrate the two forms:</p>

        language communities utilizing Ethiopic script.  In Sebatbeit publishing a number of modifications to diacritical marks are regularly
        applied to aid glyph clarity.  These modified glyphs will sometimes appear within in font as a <em>Stylistic Alternative</em> or an
        entirely separate font may be used in publishing where these letter shapes appear as the default forms.  The glyphs are enumerated here and
        are recommended for Sebatbeit liteature.</p>

      <h1>Alignment with HTML5 Layout &amp; Formatting</h1>
      <p>This appendix is introduced to help insure that the Ethiopic layout requirements in this recommendation has a sufficient and practical coverage in its scope.
    HTML5 is applied here for comparison as it is anticipated as the most frequently applied document language under which the recommendation will be applied.
    HTML5 elements will be reviewed in this appendix and remarks made to indicate that either: no recommendation is needed (western defaults are applicable),
    a document section is identified that covers the element in the Ethiopic context, or that a gap in coverage is identified and will be addressed.</p>
