    <h3>Stylistic Scope of this Document</h3>
    <p>This style guide limits its focus to the aspects of writing style that can be automated by publishing technology.  In particular technology responsible for implementing
    Web standards such as HTML, CSS, Mobile Web and Digital Publications (e.g. eBooks). The stylistical scope of this guide then covers primarily the visual style of text as
    seen by a reader and not the literary style of propose. The guide will go beyond describing best practices for the appearance of text in some cases; such as to describe
    best practices for the syntax of written symbols.  Simple syntactic rules for punctuation can be evaluated by word processing applications without requiring the analysis of
    words under their part of speach or in their role shaping grammar.</p>

    <h3>Relationship to <em>Ethiopic Layout Requirements</em></h3>
    </section>

<!--
<p> In addition to the Ethiopian and Eritrean homelands, the script is widely used througout the diaspora of these two nations. Accordingly, requirements are gathered from stakeholders engaged in Ethiopic publishing from all regions.</p>
    <p>The document does not describe implementations or issues related to specific technologies, such as CSS. Instead it describes the typographic requirements of Ethiopic in a technology-agnostic manner, so that the content remains evergreen and is equally relevant to all technologies that aim to represent Ethiopic text on the Web.</p>

    <section id="how_developed">
    <h3>How this Document was Created</h3>
    <p>This document was created by the W3C Ethiopic Layout Task Force.  The Task Force will discuss many issues and harmonize the recommendations from writer and publisher communities</p>
    <p>The following types of experts will be involved in the creation of this document:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Experts from the publishing industry representing the spectrum of traditional to modern layout practices.</li>
      <li>Ethiopian and Eritrean author and language associations.</li>
      <li>Ethiopic typography experts.</li>
      <li>Academic experts with a focus on  manuscripts, philogy and digitization.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Task Force will translate a draft of the style guide and circulate it in the publishing industry as well as among writer and language focused organizations. A workshop is planned to review responses and arrive at resolutions to support all perspectives on style under the guide.</p>

    <h3>Lists and Outline Style</h3>
      <section id="h_punctuation_lists_general_principles" class="ok">
      <h4>Lists and outlines—general principles</h4>
      <p>Lists with item markers are a common practice found in modern Ethiopic writing.  Lists may be ordered where the sequence is important and applies a “counter” that is numerical using either Ethiopic or Arabic numerals, or alphabetical applying the Ethiopic syllabary in keeping with the language of the document.  Unordered lists are also used applying basic geometrical shapes such as circles and squares, solid or hollow, or more decorative shapes at the author’s discretion. Lists may be formatted vertically, vertically and multi-level, or inline (AKA “run-in”) and single level.</p>

      <p>Style guides provide recommendations for the logical grouping of items within a list and for forming the phrases of the listed items and detail rules for their internal punctuation. In this section we focus only on formatting and positioning rules that computer software would automate for an author. List discussed here are lists that occur in text and does not apply to table of contents, lists of illustrations, lists of tables, glossaries or indexes.  These more specific kinds of lists are discussed in other sections.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="h_punctuation_lists_run_ins_versus_vertical+lists" class="ok">
      <h4>Run-in versus vertical lists</h4>
      <p>Two list layout orientations can be used. A list maybe laid out vertically, in a new paragraph with one list item per line. A list may also be presented horizontally within a sentence (known as “run-in” or “inline” lists).  Run-in lists are more appropriate when the listed items are relatively short and the list forms a sentence with the introductory text (see <a href="#h_punctuation_lists_run_ins_lists"></a>).  List where the items may be longer phrases or full sentences, or have multiple levels, should be set vertically (see <a href="#h_punctuation_lists_vertical_lists_punctuated"></a>).</p>
      </section>
      <section id="h_punctuation_lists_run_ins_lists" class="ok">
      <h4>Run-in lists</h4>
      <p>When letters or Ethiopic numerals are used to mark the items in a run-in list they should be followed by a slash, “/”. If western numbers are used
      to form a list, a dot “.” maybe used in place of slash. If the introductory material forms a grammatically complete sentence, a preface colon, “፦”, should precede the first listed item.</p>
      <p><em>(needs review)</em> Listed items should be separated by a comma, “፣”, unless item text also requires a comma, then semicolon, “፤”, should be used instead.</p>
      <p><em>TBD: Review for enclosing parenthesis use and enclosing double slash like /ሀ/</em></p>
      </section>
      <section id="h_punctuation_lists_vertical_format" class="ok">
      <h4>Vertical lists punctuation, and format</h4>
      <p>A vertical list is best introduced by a grammatically complete sentence, followed by a preface colon, “፦”.  The list that follows may then
be either ordered or unordered as introduced in Section <a href="#h_punctuation_lists_general_principles"></a>.
If the list is unordered no end punctuation is needed unless the content forms a complete sentence.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="h_punctuation_lists_vertical_lists_punctuated" class="ok">
      <h4>Vertical lists punctuated as a sentence</h4>
      <p>When vertical list items complete the sentence of the introductory text,
         commas or semicolons may be used between the items, and a period should follow the final item.
         Optionally, the introductory paragraph may continue inline following the final list item as depicted in
         <a href="#fig_punctuation_lists_vertical_lists_punctuated"></a>:

      <h4>Ordered list counter suffix</h4>
      <p>The list “counter” is the number or letter that begins a list entry (e.g. “3”, “፫” or “ሐ”). The “list counter suffix” (also called the “list item marker”) is the symbol that follows, or in some case surrounds, the counter.  For example: “.”, “/” or “()” in “3.”, “፫/” and “(ሐ)”.</p>

      <p>The recommended counter suffix for Ethiopic text in any language is the slash “/” symbol.  Slash is recommended as the default suffix while authors are allowed to easily switch to a common alternative such as “፦”, “.”, “)” and “፡”. </p>

      <section id="h_punctuation_lists_counter_suffix_alignment" class="ok">
      <h4>List counter suffix alignment</h4>
      <p>In vertical lists, the list item text should initiate at the same horizontal position from the left margin.
      <!-- The content of vertical list items should be justified on the left such that the start of list text is at the same horizontal position on a page. -->
         It  is recommended that this positioning be achieved by aligning the list counter suffixes.  The resulting list should appear as if the list were laid out in a table
         where the counter and its suffix appear right-justified in the first column, and the list text appearing left justified in the second column.

  <section id="h_emphasis">
  <h2>Emphasis</h2>
    <p>Emphasis can be expressed in a number of common approaches such as italics, boldface and underscore which maintain the
       same underlying typeface.  In past eras that predate digital publishing, a change in the font size as well as to the
       underlying typeface, are more common approaches. This section provides guidance on applying the various approaches to
       emphasis.</p>
    <section id="h_emphasis_reproduction" class="ok">
    <h3>Emphasis in republished works</h3>
       <p>When a pre-digital or early digital work is reproduced with modern software, it is recommended that the style of emphasis
       used in the original work be preserved in the updated form. Unless it can be determined that a particular style of emphasis
       because a technical limitation did not allow for a preferred style of emphasis to be employed.  In this case the change of
       emphasis style would be acceptable as it reflects the intent of the author.  For example, underlined text should not be changed
       to italics in a republishing of a work unless it is known that the author had desired italics emphasis but it was unavailable
       at the time.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="h_emphasis_italic" class="ok">
    <h3>Italics for emphasis</h3>
       <p>In works using a modern, thin weight, typeface, italic text may be used effectively for emphasis.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="h_emphasis_boldface" class="ok">
    <h3>Boldface for emphasis</h3>
       <p>In works using the classic, heavy typeface, bold emphasis should not be used as it can be difficult to
       distinguish from the regular weight. An exception is found when a classic typeface is specifically designed for the bold
       appearance, in which case it is most suitable for chapter and section titles.</p>
       <p>In works using a modern, thinner weight, typefaces, emboldened text may be used effectively for emphasis and is most
       appropriate for chapter and section titles. When the typeface
       used to render a document will be unknown, boldface should be avoided emphasis in favor of underline or italics.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="h_emphasis_underscore" class="ok">
    <h3>Underscore for emphasis</h3>
       <p>Underscore (also called “underline”) is a more appropriate form of emphasis for the classic weight typeface and has some
       historic precedence in Ethiopic publishing, particularly where only a single typeface was available. When a document uses underscore for a
       special purpose, such as to denote a the presence of a hyperlink, underscore should then be avoided in favor of italics.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="h_emphasis_inline_size_change" class="ok">
    <h3>Size change for emphasis</h3>
       <p>In works where only a single typeface could be used, emphasis expressed mid-sentence is sometimes shown by enlarging the font size by around 25%
       of the regular height.  Increasing the text size is sometimes used as an alternative to boldface or in a way analogous to “All Caps” in western
       writing.  The approach should primarily be used only when reproducing a work where it has been applied in the original publication.
       Text size change may used cautiously when it has been determined that another form of emphasis is unsuitable.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="h_emphasis_manuscript_typeface" class="ok">
    <h3>Typeface change for emphasis</h3>
       <p>In some older, pre-digital, works emphasis can be shown by changing the typeface from the classic (“Zemen”) style to an even older
       style as would be found in manuscripts and early mechanical publishing.  The typeface style change might also be accompanied by a
       change in text height.  It is recommended that this approach only be used only when reproducing a work where it has been applied in the
       original publication. The change to a manuscript style typeface can be used in lieu of a suitable italic typeface.</p>
