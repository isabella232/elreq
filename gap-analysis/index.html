    <p>This document describes and prioritises gaps for the support of languages using the Ethiopic script on the Web and in eBooks. In particular, it is concerned with text layout. It checks that needed features are supported in W3C specifications, in particular HTML and CSS and those relating to digital publications. It also checks whether the features have been implemented in browsers and ereaders. This document complements the document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/elreq/">Ethiopic Layout Requirements</a>, which describes the requirements for areas where gaps appear. It is linked to from the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html">language matrix</a> that tracks Web support for many languages.</p>
<p>The editor's draft of this document is being developed by the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/elreq/">Ethiopic Layout Task Force</a>, part of the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/ig/">Internationalization Interest Group</a>. It is published by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/core/">Internationalization Working Group</a>. The end target for this document is a Working Group Note.</p>
</div>

  <section id="h_introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the  needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as people expect around the world.</p>
<p>This page documents difficulties people encounter when trying to use the Amharic and Tigriña languages in the Ethiopic script on the Web. </p>
<p>Having identified an issue, it investigates the current status with regards to web specifications and implementations by user agents (browsers, e-readers, etc.), and attempts to prioritise the severity of the issue for web users.</p>
<p>A summary of this report and others can be found as part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html" style="font-size: 140%;">language matrix</a>.</p>
    
    <section id="workflow">
    <h3>Work flow</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 140%;">This version of the document is a preliminary analysis</span></p>

    <p>Gap analysis work usually starts with a <strong>preliminary analysis</strong>, conducted quickly by one or a small group of experts. Then a more <strong>detailed analysis</strong> is carried out, involving a wider range of experts. The detailed analysis may involve the development of tests, in order to illustrate issues and track results for browsers. The next phase is <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong>. It is expected that the resulting document will not be frozen: as gaps are fixed, this should be noted in the document. It is also possible that new gaps are noticed or arise, and they can be added to this document when that happens.</p>
    
    <p>As the gap analysis develops, the requirements for features that are problematic should be described in the companion document, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/elreq/">Ethiopic Layout Requirements</a>. Links to the appropriate part of that document should be added to this document as the material is created. Note that the requirements document should not contain any technology-specific information: all of that belongs here.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="prioritization">
    <h3>Prioritization</h3>
    <p>This document not only describes gaps, it also attempts to prioritise them in terms of the impact on the local user. The prioritisation is indicated by colour.</p>
        
        <p>Key:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li class="ok"></li>
        <li class="na"></li>
        <li class="advanced"></li>
        <li class="basic"></li>
        <li class="broken"></li>
        <li class="tbd"></li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>It is important to note that these colours do not indicate to what extent a particular features is broken. They indicate the impact of a broken or missing feature on the content author or end user.</p>
    <p>Basic styling is the level that would be generally accepted as sufficient for most Web pages. Advanced level support would include additional features one might expect to include in ebooks or other advanced typographic formats. There may be features of a script or language that are not supported on the Web, but that are not generally regarded as necessary (usually archaic or obscure features). In this case, the feature can be described here, but the status should be marked as OK.</p>
    <p>The decision as to what priority level is assigned to a described gap is down to the experts doing the gap analysis. It may not always be straightforward to decide. If a given section in this document refers to more than one feature that is broken, each with different impacts on Web users, the priority for the section should be the lowest denominator.</p>
    <p>A cell can be scored as OK if the feature in question is specified in an appropriate specification, and is supported by user agents. A specification that is in CR or later and has two implementations in 'major' browsers will count. This means that the feature may not be supported in all browsers yet. (At some point in the future we may try to distinguish, visually, whether support is available in a specification but still pending in major browsers or applications.) </p>

<h3>Glyph shaping and positioning</h3>
<p id="prompt-glyphs" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


    <p>Gemination and vowel length marks are typically at a fixed height above the tallest character in printed material, but in handwriting the marks are just above the base character, and therefore at varying heights. It's not clear, however, that a control is needed for ajusting such diacritic heights.</p>
    <p>See an <a href="https://w3c.github.io/elreq/#ethiopic_gemination_mark_positioning">example in the layout requirements document</a>.</p>

<section id="transform_spaces">
<h4>Converting wordspace to space &amp; vice-versa</h4>
    <p>There should be a way to automatically convert word-space characters to ordinary spaces, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://w3c.github.io/elreq/#space_wordspace_substitution_rules">layout requirements document</a> has an algorithm that can be used to convert between the two.</p>

<section id="segmentation" class="ok">
<h3>Grapheme/word segmentation &amp; selection</h3>
<p id="prompt-segmentation" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


    <p>There's a question about whether double-click selection should pick up the wordspace character as well (it does in MS Word, but spaces are not picked up in Firefox for text with normal spaces between words...).</p>
<!--section id="xxxxxx">
<h4>xxxxxx</h4>
<p></p>

<section id="text_decoration" class="basic">
<h3>Text decoration</h3>
<p id="prompt-text_decoration" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


 <section id="underline_thickness">
<h4>Underline needs to be thicker</h4>
   <p>Underlines in Ethiopic text need to be thicker than in English text. Some control is needed over the thickness of the underline. This may be an advanced issue.</p>
</section>
   
   
<section id="underline_wordspace">
<h4>Wordspace should be underlined</h4>

<p>When underlining a word followed by an ethiopic wordspace, the punctuation should also receive the underline. (See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/elreq/#emphasis_with_wordspace">the relevant section</a> in the Ethiopic Layout Requirements doc.) The CSS Text Decoration spec, Level 4 <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-decor-4/#valdef-text-decoration-skip-spaces">currently says that</a> text-decoration-skip:spaces would not underline Ethiopic word spaces. This seems like a basic issue.</p>
<p>A <a href="tests/ethi/wordspace_underline">test is available</a> for this, but text-decoration-skip:spaces doesn't appear to be supported yet by browsers. The issue may arise when implementations begin to provide support for that value.</p>
</section>

<section id="highlight_wordspace">
<h4>Wordspace should be highlighted</h4>

    <p>When highlighting or emphasising a word followed by an ethiopic wordspace, the punctuation should also receive the highlight. This includes underlines, for which there is currently an issue (see above).</p>
</section>
</section>



<section id="quotations" class="ok">
<h3>Quotations</h3>
<p id="prompt-quotations" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>

</section>



<section id="data_formats" class="tbd">
<h3>Data formats &amp; numbers</h3>
<p id="prompt-data_formats" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


<section id="number_lining">
<h4>Numbers need lines above and below</h4>

    <p>Digits have lines above and below. Modern practice tends to use discreet lines associated with each characters, however older texts used a single line across the whole set of adjacent digits. See examples in the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/elreq/#space_wordspace_substitution_rules">layout requirements document</a>. This difference is likely due to technology constraints. Presumably, a continuous line could be applied using OpenType functionality, but there may be a question about whether a control should allow to switch between one style and the other.</p>
<p>Try the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/tests/ethi/numeral-bars.html">test page</a>.</p>
<p>Initial results indicate that a single line is produced by Noto Sans Ethiopic and Noto Serif Ethiopic, but not by Kefa or Abyssinica SIL fonts.</p>
<p>There is a question as to whether this should be managed by font choice, or whether a switch should be available to users, eg. in CSS, that allows the desired approach to be applied.</p>
<p>In addition to the question just mentioned, I'm not able to ascertain the impact of this feature for the user, so no priority has been assigned at this point.</p>

<h3>Line breaking</h3>
<p id="prompt-line_breaking" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


<section id="line_end_characters">
<h4>Characters at line end and start</h4>
    <p>Need to run a test to check whether the ethiopic characters that shouldn't appear at line end/start behave as expected given the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/elreq/#ethiopic_line_breaking">elreq rules</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="word_breaks">
<h4>Text should break inside words</h4>
<p>And need to test whether lines break between characters. <span class="pass">Firefox</span> appears to allow this, but <span class="fail">Chrome</span> and <span class="fail">Safari</span> wrap whole words (with wordspace) instead. Marking this, therefore, as basic issue. Need to check what the CSS spec says.</p>

<h3>Text alignment &amp; justification</h3>
<p id="prompt-justification" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


  <section id="wordspace_expansion">
<h4>Wordspace should expand during justification</h4>
  <p>When text uses ethiopic wordspace the wordspace should expand to assist in justification. Need some tests to check whether than happens. This is a basic issue, so if tests fail, we need to change the status of this section.</p>
  </section>

<section id="wordspace_position">
<h4>Position of wordspace when expanded</h4>

<p>However, there need to be some rules about how to position the ink within the wordspace character (with the word, or centred), and a control to allow the preferred style of positioning. I'm classifying that as an advanced control. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/elreq/#ethiopic_justification">the requirements</a>.</p>

   <p>Ethiopic script text uses local counter styles. While some of these are supported by some browsers, the set of symbols used and their order varies by language. Custom counter styles can be created using Firefox only. The CSS spec needs to become a Rec and more browsers need to support it.</p>
</section>
   
<section id="counter_style_alignment">
<h4>Alignment of counters in lists</h4>

<p>There is also a question (which is probably an advanced issue) about whether counters should align to the left or right.</p>
